## View your QR Code

Directly after logging in to the application, you will be directed to your QR code page. This QR code containers your unique profile url, which will direct someone to your profile page on the Betterflye website if they scan your QR code. If you navigate away from this page, you can get back to it by pressing the "Your QR Code" button on the bottom navigation bar.

## Scan a QR Code

After pressing the "Scan a QR Code" button on the bottom navigation bar, you are directed to a page where you can scan a QR code. By pressing the "Scan" button, your camera is opened and you have to position your camera so that the QR code is within the square on your screen. Hold the camera in this position until the scan is finished, when you will be directed back to the Scan page, where the result will be displayed in a pop-up bar.

## View Betterflye Initiatives

After pressing the "List of Initiatives" button on the bottom navigation bar, you are directed to a page where you see a list of initiatives from the Betterflye platform. You can click on any initiative from the list to see expanded details of that particular initiative.

## Logout of your Account

From any page on the bottom navigation bar, you can press the drawer button located in the top left of the screen, which opens the drawer containing the "Logout" button. By pressing the logout button, you will be logged out of your account and returned to the start page.
