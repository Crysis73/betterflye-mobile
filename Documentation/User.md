# User Documentation

Currently using the Betterflye Mobile application users are able to:

1. Create an account on the Betterflye platform
2. Login using their created credentials
3. See their unique user QR Code, which directs anyone who scans it to their profile page on the Betterflye website
4. Log out of their account.

## Create An Account

To create an account, after opening the application, press the sign up button. You'll be directed to a screen where you can enter in your first name, your last name, and tick a checkbox confirming that you are at least 13 years old.

After entering in the above information, press the next button, and you'll be directed to a page where you can enter in your username, email, and password. Once you've finished entering in that information, click sign up!

## Login to your Account

To login to your account, after opening the application, press the login button. You'll be directed to a page where you can enter in your username and password. Once you've entered in your username and password, if your username and password are correct, you'll be directed to your profile page!

## View your QR Code

After logging in to the application, the only screen that you can interact with displays a QR Code that contains your unique profile url! If you have someone scan it, they will be directed to your profile on the Betterflye website.

## Logout of your Acount

While on your QR Code page, there is a Logout button which logs you out of your account and sends you back to the start page.
