## View your QR Code

Directly after logging in to the application, you will be directed to your QR code page. This QR code contains your unique profile url, which will direct someone to your profile page on the Betterflye website if they scan your QR code. If you navigate away from this page, you can get back to it by pressing the "Your Qr Code" button on the bottom navigation bar.

## Check Yourself Into an Initiative Shift

*Note: A user must have already registered for a shift on the Betterflye website in order to check in for that shift.*

*Note: If Betterflye does not have camera access on your phone, you will be notified when you try to scan a QR code and directed to your settings to allow access.*

To check yourself into an initiative shift, press the "Self Check In" button on the bottom navigation bar. Next, press the "Check In/Out" button on that page which opens up your phone's camera, where you then must scan the initiative QR code provided by the initiative manager.

## Check a User In or Out of an Initiative Shift

*Note: A user must have already registered for a shift on the Betterflye website in order to check in for that shift.*

*Note: If Betterflye does not have camera access on your phone, you will be notified when you try to scan a QR code and directed to your settings to allow access.*

From the initiative list seen above, you can click on any initiative to see a list of shifts for that initiative. Next, you press the "Check In/Out" button, and scan the user's QR code to check them in if they need checked in, or it checks them out if they are already checked in. If the user has already logged their shift, you will be notified.

By pressing the "QR Code" tab at the top of the initiative shift page, you will see the QR code for this initiative. Those wishing to self check-in will need to scan this QR code.
