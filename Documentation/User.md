## View your QR Code

Directly after logging in to the application, you will be directed to your QR code page. This QR code contains your unique profile url, which will direct someone to your profile page on the Betterflye website if they scan your QR code. If you navigate away from this page, you can get back to it by pressing the "Your Qr Code" button on the bottom navigation bar.

## Check a User In or Out of an Initiative Shift

From the initiative list seen above, you can click on any initiative to see a list of shifts for that initiative. Next, you press the "Check In/Out" button, and scan the user's QR code to check them in if they need checked in, or it checks them out if they are already checked in. If the user has already logged their shift, you will be notified.

**If Betterflye does not have camera access on your phone, you will be notified when you try to scan a QR code and directed to your settings to allow access.**

## Logout of your Account

From any page accessed from the bottom navigation bar, you can press the drawer button located in the top left of the screen, which opens the drawer containing the "Logout" button. By pressing the logout button, you will be logged out of your account and returned to the start page.
