## Topics Discussed

This meeting was our final team meeting, which took place directly after our closure presentation.

- First, we talked about our closure presentation.
  - Our professor was very happy with our group and project, so the team discussed our happiness as well.
- We once again talked about the Capstone Showcase, which Clay said he is excited to present at.
- Next, we started talking about what all is left with this class and this semester.
  - We realized we are still waiting for our iteration 5 grade, so that is something we can look forward to.
- Next, we talked about the team's plans for the summer/future.
  - The team is looking for jobs and currently going through the interview process.
- The team also discussed about staying in touch when that is possible.
- Next, Clay showed us his presentation he made for the Capstone Showcase.
  - We went through all the slides, and he asked for our feedback on them.
  - Other than one minor typo corrected, the slideshow was perfect!
- Lastly, we all said our goodbyes!

## Things Clarified
