## Topics Discussed

This meeting was to discuss our mentor and client meetings and to finish touching up all of our iteration 2 assignments.

- First, we discussed everybody's thoughts about our meetings.
  - We all agreed we thought they went well, as everyone was happy with our progress and gave us good ideas for the next iteration.
- Next, we put these suggestions into our kanban board.
  - We went through and created all of our tasks for iteration 3, and gave each one a description and an estimate of time needed to complete it.
  - These features are:
    - QR scanning checks that user into an initiative
    - Make initiative list page show only initiatives created or managed by that user
    - Move QR code scanner into the initiative container
    - Make a user profile page
    - Make an initiative shift page
- After we created all of these items, we created a release for iteration 2.
- Finally, we submitted all of our documentation and software.

## Things Clarified

- We need to complete our iteration 2 presentation soon so we are ready for our presentation at 3:00 on Friday.
- Over break, if you have free time you can work on the project if you want, but you are not required to do anything if you don't want to.
