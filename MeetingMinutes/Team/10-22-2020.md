## Topics Discussed

- First Meeting:
  - We opened up our documents, and discussed how we would present our items.
  - We decided it would be best to just show them our markdown files and walk them through it.
- Second Meeting:
  - We went through our use cases to try to make our langauge more formal.
  - We also went through the rest of our items to find any language that could use improvement.
  - We finished touching up our domain model with all of the feedback from both our mentor and client.
    - We got rid of the badge class.

## Things Clarified

- We can start our presentation for design day over the weekend.
- If we find any other items in our design that need improvement, we can change them.
