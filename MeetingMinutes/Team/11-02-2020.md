## Topics Discussed

- We discussed how many times a week we should do standups for us to give each other updates on the project.
- Next, we discussed git flow for our project.
  - Always make a new branch when working on a new feature.
- Next, Casey walked us through a sample app he made that looked like what our project might look like.
  - This app handled login and sign up pages.
- Our mentor made an API that we will use in our project, so we walked through practicing using the API.
- After walking through the sample app, we assigned who will work on which features for our first iteration.

## Things Clarified

- We will have short standup meetings every Monday, Wednesday, and Friday at 3:00.
- We assigned everybody one feature to start working on, which is listed under our Kanban board on our main code base repository.
