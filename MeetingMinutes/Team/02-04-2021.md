## Topics Discussed

This was our Thursday standup, where we showed any progress made and discussed future plans for the project.

- First, Casey walked the team through his changes and discussed his updated pull request.
  - We noticed a build failure happening with flutter analyze in our GitHub Actions, which Casey said he will fix.
  - Casey also showed us how he separated a lot of the logic out of the initiative shift state and into a handler, which he said he wants us to do for a lot of our other pages.
  - Finally, we reviewed his pull request and merged it
- After this, we discussed our plans to try and clean up our code before this meeting.
  - However, nobody has made any changes yet.
- Next, we looked ahead to see what else needed done for us to submit by Monday.
  - Matt volunteered to make the presentation after our meetings tomorrow.
  - Jacob volunteered to update our user documentation before our meetings tomorrow.
