## Topics Discussed

This meeting was our Wednesday standup. Here is a recap of our progress:

- Matt
  - Matt has ran into some issues with his Flutter on his device, so he has been figuring that out. He will continue trying to fix this, then he can finish the bottom navigation bar.
- Jacob and Clay
  - Jacob and Clay pair-programmed the QR scanning state and view. It is mostly finished, but needs tested on a real device before they will finish.
- Casey
  - Casey has completed and merged three bugs/fixes. He will start to work more on the Docker environment.
- Riley
  - Riley has been a little busy, so he has only started the outline for the initiative page view. He will continue working on this.

## Things Clarified

- We need to make sure our working branches are up to date with develop branch to reduce merge conflicts.
- Clay and Jacob will pair program again at 11:00 Thursday to finish their tasks.
