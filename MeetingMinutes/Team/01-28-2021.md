## Topics Discussed

This was our Thursday standup, where we showed any progress made and discussed future plans for the project.

- First, Clay and Riley showed their progres on the initiative shift page view. They have made progress, but still have more changes to make before the view is done. They asked for help when it comes to communicating the view with the state once they get there.
- Next, Jacob showed the progress that he and Matt made on the profile page and state. They basically finished the view and state, but still need to work on tests.
  - Later, Casey was working with Jacob and they made some changes to the state.
  - Matt could not make it to this meeting, which he made sure the team knew beforehand.
- Next, Jacob explained that he still has a bug in the initiative list page state, and cannot find a way to fix it. After the standup ended, Casey and Jacob worked it out.

## Things Clarified

- We need to prepare for our meeting with Tim tomorrow at 5:00.
- This is the halfway point of iteration 3, so we need to make sure we continue working efficiently on our tasks.
