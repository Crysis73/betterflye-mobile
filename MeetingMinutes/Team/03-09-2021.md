## Topics Discussed

This meeting was our Tuesday standup where we showed any progress made. We also used this meeting to discuss our presentation and professor's feedback and to choose tasks.

- This meeting took place right after our presentation, so we first discussed how we thought that went.
  - We all talked about everything again and agreed we thought we did a good job, and were glad that our professor was also pleased with our work.

- Next, we each chose one or more tasks to start working on for the fifth iteration.
  - Casey: Schedule page.
  - Clay: Encode less information in QR codes.
  - Matt: Add extra padding to bottom of initiative page. Add extra padding to bottom of initiative shift page. Schedule page.
  - Riley: Disallow blank characters in registration. Allow apostrophes in registration.
  - Jacob: Make buttons look how they used to with Flutter 2.0. Move Profile page from bottom bar to drawer.

## Things Clarified

- We need to start working on our tasks for the fifth iteration.
