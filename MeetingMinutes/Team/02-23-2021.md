## Topics Discussed

This was our Tuesday standup, where we showed any progress made and discussed future plans for the project.

- First, Casey explained the progress on his research case.
  - Casey is still brainstorming what path we should go. He has been documenting his thoughts and progress, but is still contemplating which is the best route to go for this background service.
- Next, Riley explained the progress on his task.
  - Riley has started moving some of the duplicated logic to a handler, but wants help on how to best move forward for some of the logic. Casey will work with him to resolve this task.

Nobody else has had a specific task to finish, so the team discussed what to do next.

- Clay will sign us up for the symposium.
- Riley will message Tim to set up a meeting for Thursday at 5:30.
- Jacob will update the documentation more, but he says he needs more screenshots of our updated app.
- On Thursday, we will review the new code changes made by Riley, the documentation changes, and do a check of our software to try and catch any last minute bugs.

## Things Clarified

- We will meet with Tim at 5:30 on Thursday for our mid-iteration mentor meeting.
- Next Tuesday, we will hold a retrospection to review our work for this fourth iteration.
