## Topics Discussed

This meeting was to get feedback from our client on our first iteration assignments.

- User Documentation Feedback:
  - First, we walked Virginie through our user documentation.
  - Virginie said it looks good.
- Development Documentation Feedback:
  - Next, we walked Virginie through our development documentation.
  - Virginie said this looks good as well.
- Deployment Documentation Feedback:
  - Next, we walked Virginie through our deployment documentation.
  - We explained our difficulties with deploying on iOS, because none of us have a Mac so we need to do research for how deployment might work for Apple without an Apple computer.
  - Virginie said this looked good as well, and she might help us look into iOS deployment.
- Software Feedback:
  - Finally, we walked Virginie through each page of our app, explaining our error-catching and functionality (just like we did with Tim).
  - We asked specifically for any feedback on the UI, and Virginie stated that it's simple, but looks good.
  - She added we could potentially add some badges to our start page, just like the website. She said our app is "pretty enough".
  - The Betterflye website is currently undergoing massive UI changes, so our app might change along with it.
  - Virginie said she is happy with what he have completed so far.

## Things Clarified

- We asked Virginie if she had functionality she specifically wanted for our second iteration.
- She stated she would like some more time to think about it, then we can meet on Wednesday at 3:00 when she makes a decision.
  - We showed Virginie our requirements list, and some ideas for next iteration features were a page for initiatives, sending appreciations through QR scanning, but most likely checking into events through QR scanning.
