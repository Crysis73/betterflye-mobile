## • BR1: Make it easier for volunteer hours to be validated

Organizations need the ability to track the number of volunteers and volunteer hours so they can use that data to make informed decisions. Volunteers need a way for their hours to be validated so they can receive "credit" from various institutions. While the functionality to validate volunteer hours exists in the web version of Betterflye, the process can be simplified by the use of mobile specific technology. The simplification of verifying volunteer hours is expressed in the Betterflye vision.

## • BR2: Extend the Betterflye platform to a larger audience via mobile applications

The mobile application is an extension of the Betterflye philosophy itself: make it easier for people to volunteer and for event organizers to recruit volunteers. Our client wants us to take an existing platform and make it functional on mobile devices so that they can reach a much wider audience.
